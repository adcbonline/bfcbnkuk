<h5><strong> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#q17">How to understand a multi-currency notional pooling facility</a></strong></h5>
<hr />
<div id="q17" class="collapse">
<p class="body">A Notional Pooling Facility combines the end balances in all of the client's current accounts that are included to arrive at an aggregated net balance. A Multi-Currency Notional Pooling Facility does the same across different currencies. The aggregated net balance will be the Sterling equivalent of the currency balances held after a margin has been determined to allow for exchange rate movements.</p>
<p class="body">Subject to approval, you can arrange to have an agreed overdraft facility on one or more current accounts. This is conditional on the availability of sufficient equivalent funds <strong>(as determined by BFC Bank Ltd)</strong> held on other Sterling current and/or foreign currency current accounts within the Notional Pooling Facility.</p>
<p class="body">This aggregate net balance will take in to account:</p>
<ul>
<li>The credit balances available on Current Account(s) in the Notional Pooling Facility</li>
<li>The debit balances on Current Account(s) in the Notional Pooling Facility</li>
<li>The undrawn amounts of any approved overdraft facilities on Current Account(s) in the Notional Pooling Facility</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">This will reduce the number of times a business will need to move funds between different currencies in accounts, saving both time and money.</p>
<p class="body">An example of this may be the need for a business to pay an urgent invoice in US Dollars but have an insufficient balance in the US Dollar current account to make the payment. There may be US Dollar funds due in at a later date but not before this particular invoice has to be settled. If the business has a Multi-Currency Notional Pooling Facility it would enable the US Dollar invoice to be paid by using this agreed overdraft facility against the sufficient equivalent available funds in other current account(s).</p>
<p class="body">This eliminates the need to undertake any foreign exchange transfers into the US Dollar account to pay the invoice. It would also eliminate the need to then transfer funds back once the US Dollar funds they were expecting had been received.</p>
<p class="body"><strong>Please note that an Overall Maximum Limit will need to be agreed to determine the extent that a business may overdraw an account.</strong></p>
<p class="body"><strong>Please also note that debit interest will be charged to the account that is overdrawn in that account's currency and, where applicable, credit interest applied to the account that is in credit in the account's currency. Under the BFC Bank Multi-Currency Notional Pooling Facility interest is not calculated on the aggregate net balance; it is calculated on the balances of each individual account.</strong></p>
